    // Basic fields
}

// KickScore Live (Kotlin - original implementation)
data class Match(
    val id: String,
    val homeTeam: Team,
    val awayTeam: Team,
    val homeScore: Int?,
    val awayScore: Int?,
    val status: MatchStatus,
    val startTime: LocalDateTime,
    val league: League,
    val minute: Int?,
    val venue: String,
    val isLive: Boolean
) {
    fun getWinner(): Team? = // Original extension functions
