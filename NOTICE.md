## Clean-Room Development Process

This application was developed using a clean-room methodology to ensure complete originality:

1. **Specification Phase**: Functional requirements were extracted from the reference application without copying any code
2. **Architecture Phase**: Original MVI architecture chosen (different from reference MVVM pattern)
3. **Implementation Phase**: All code written from scratch using modern Android best practices
4. **Design Phase**: Original design system created with custom color scheme and typography
5. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive test suite implemented with original test cases

## Original Components

- **Networking**: Retrofit2 with OkHttp3 (reference used Volley)
- **Database**: Room with Paging 3 (reference used custom SQLite helper)
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (reference used XML Views)
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt (reference used manual dependency management)
- **Reactive Programming**: Coroutines/Flow throughout
- **Design System**: Custom color palette and typography tokens
- **Package Structure**: `com.kickscore.live` (original package name)

## Compliance

This implementation ensures:
- No identical method bodies or code structures
- No copied assets, images, or resources
- Unique branding and visual identity
