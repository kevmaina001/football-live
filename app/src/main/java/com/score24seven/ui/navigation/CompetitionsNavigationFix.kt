/*
 * Navigation Fix for Competitions Screen with Date Filtering
 * Update Score24SevenNavigation.kt with these changes:
 */

/*
Add this import:
import com.score24seven.ui.screen.FixedCompetitionsScreen

Replace Screen.Matches.route composable with:
        composable(Screen.Matches.route) {
            FixedCompetitionsScreen(
                onNavigateBack = {
                    navController.popBackStack()
                },
                onNavigateToCompetition = { competitionId ->
                    navController.navigate(Screen.CompetitionMatches.createRoute(competitionId))
                }
            )
        }

This will:
✅ Show competitions filtered by selected date
✅ Update competition counts dynamically based on selected date
✅ Provide proper date filtering functionality
✅ Maintain the same navigation flow to CompetitionMatchesScreen
✅ Include comprehensive debug logging

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
If you prefer to keep the individual matches view, you can also replace it with:
        composable(Screen.Matches.route) {
            FixedMatchesScreen(
                onNavigateBack = {
                    navController.popBackStack()
                },
                onNavigateToMatchDetail = { matchId ->
                    navController.navigate(Screen.MatchDetail.createRoute(matchId)) {
                        launchSingleTop = true
                    }
                }
            )
        }

Choose based on your preference:
- FixedCompetitionsScreen: Shows competitions grouped by league for selected date
- FixedMatchesScreen: Shows individual matches for selected date
