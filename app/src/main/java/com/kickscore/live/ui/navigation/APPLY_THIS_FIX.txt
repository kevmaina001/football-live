✅ APPLY THIS NAVIGATION FIX FOR OPTION A (COMPETITIONS VIEW WITH DATE FILTERING)

In KickScoreNavigation.kt, make these 2 simple changes:

1. ADD THIS IMPORT (around line 24-25):
   import com.kickscore.live.ui.screen.FixedCompetitionsScreen

2. REPLACE LINES 50-59:
   From:
        composable(Screen.Matches.route) {
            CompetitionsScreen(
                onNavigateBack = {
                    navController.popBackStack()
                },
                onNavigateToCompetition = { competitionId ->
                    navController.navigate(Screen.CompetitionMatches.createRoute(competitionId))
                }
            )
        }

   To:
        composable(Screen.Matches.route) {
            FixedCompetitionsScreen(
                onNavigateBack = {
                    navController.popBackStack()
                },
                onNavigateToCompetition = { competitionId ->
                    navController.navigate(Screen.CompetitionMatches.createRoute(competitionId))
                }
            )
        }

That's it! After this change:

✅ Matches tab will show competitions with working date filters
✅ Date selection will actually filter competitions by date
✅ Competition counts will update dynamically
✅ Clicking a competition will navigate to CompetitionMatchesScreen as before
✅ Full debug logging will show what's happening

The navigation flow remains:
Matches Tab → FixedCompetitionsScreen (with date filtering) → CompetitionMatchesScreen → MatchDetailScreen
